# Windows Service Restart Scheduler in Python
This script can be used to automate restart of Windows Service based on Time Scheduling

I have used Teamviewer as a test service.
Note: Make sure to run the script with administrative rights as Service Restart would preferably refer admin privileges.

How to RUN
1. Install Python
2. Initialse environment path
3. Install dependencies (scheduler) using (CMD> pip install scheduler) 
4. Run py appname.py
